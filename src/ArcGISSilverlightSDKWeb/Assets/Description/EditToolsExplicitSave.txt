This sample demonstrates using the ESRI.ArcGIS.Client Editor on a FeatureLayer where the edit changes are saved explicitly by the person editing the maps features. Individual Editor functions like: Save, Add, Select, ClearSelection, EditVerticies, etc. are bound to Buttons using the Command property. Additional Editor functions like: Freehand, AutoComplete, AutoSelect, and ContinuousMode are bound to CheckBoxes using the IsChecked property. The 'Cancel Edits' has code-behind logic to undo any graphic added to the map up to the last save that was issued.

To use the sample, use the Add Polygon button to draw a polygon on the map.  Use other buttons to move, modify, select or delete features.  Use the Save Edits button to commit edits to the database.  Cancel Edits will clear all edits up to that point.
